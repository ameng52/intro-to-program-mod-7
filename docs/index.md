# Python Pickling and Structured Error Handling 
**Dev:**  *AMeng*  
**Date:** *11.29.2022*
## Introduction
  In this assignment, we utilized python pickling and structured error handling in a python script. We were asked to find sources detailing these topics and demonstrate our understanding. 
## Method
I decided to create a python script that resembles our previous assignments of editing a to do list, and given the numerical aspect that pickling involves, I changed priority from a string variable to an integer. 
The new topics covered this week were python pickling and structured error handling.
## Pickling
Python pickling involves serializing and/or deserializing a python object structure.
Pickling can be used to convert a python object and turn it into a character stream, that can be further transform the object in another script. 
This process can be used to transport data/ share objects, and in this assignment, we will be storing data, pickling it into a binary file, which must be unpickled afterwards.
